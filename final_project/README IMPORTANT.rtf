\f0\fs24 \cf0 Code needs the asset to actually work so it needs the full FINAL PROJECT FOLDER. \
I made this file to import the Rhino asset from the folder, it then attaches it to a cube so the cube\'92s rotation will make the Rhino move. It then ROTATES the cube so the rhino will be added in a different location than usual. The file also automatically saves itself after running. (I got this idea because we were talking about Rhinos in Black Panther and you said \'93NO MORE TALKING ABOUT RHINOS\'94 so we could move on for class.) }
